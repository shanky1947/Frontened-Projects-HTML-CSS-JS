                    <p>Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) is a private university located in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. Founded in 1984, as Vellore Engineering College, by G. Viswanathan, the institution offers 20 undergraduate, 34 postgraduate, four integrated and four research programs. VIT consolidated its disciplines into 20 Schools of Study with the addition of the VIT Law School at its Chennai campus.[4][5]
                        VIT implements the Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCS) which gives the students flexibility to make their own time tables by choosing the subjects and the faculties under whose guidance they want to study. VIT admits bachelor students through its own engineering entrance exam, called the Vellore Institute of Technology Engineering Entrance Examination (VITEEE). It is conducted every year in the month of April and May. The exam has been conducted online since 2013[8] and in 2018, 212,000 students have registered.</p>
